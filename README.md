Favorite Season - Word Guess
Input letters until you solve the puzzle. When you solve it, it tracks your wins until you guess the next letter for the next puzzle. Also, tracks your losses if you don't solve the puzzle in less than 12 guesses.

Motivation
The challenge was to create a similar hangman game. I decided to go with what is your favorite season theme.
